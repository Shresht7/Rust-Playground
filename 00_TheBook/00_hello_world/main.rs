// The `fn` keyword is used to define a function.
// `main` is a special function that is always the first to run when rust programs are executed
fn main() {

    //  Prints the string to the screen.
    //  `println!` looks like a function but is actually a macro (as signified by the !). More on macros later.
    //  Note that semi-colons mark the end of statements and are required.
    println!("Hello World");

}

//  Compile this program using rustc and run the executable. Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled language like C, C++.
