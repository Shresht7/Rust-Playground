//  A struct, or structure, is a custom data type that lets you name and package together multiple related
//  values that make up a meaningful group. A struct is like an object's data attributes.

//  Struts are similar to tuples, the pieces of structs can be different types. Unlike tuples, you'll name
//  each piece of data so it's clear what the values mean. As a result, structs are more flexible than tuples
//  you don't have to rely on the order of the data to specify or access the values of an instance

//  the instance of the struct the method is being called upon.

//  To define the function within the context of Rectangle, we start with an implementation block (impl). Everything within this block will be
//  associated with Rectangle type. We define a function area that takes a reference to self as its parameter. Methods must have a parameter named &self
//  of type Self for their first parameter. This helps with organization.
